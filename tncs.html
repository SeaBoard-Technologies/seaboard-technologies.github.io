<h3 id="38.-liability-for-losses-arising-from-unauthorised-transactions."><strong>38. Liability for losses arising from Unauthorised Transactions.</strong></h3>

<p>38.1 You are fully liable for actual loss arising from an Unauthorised Transaction where any Account User’s recklessness was the primary cause of the loss. Recklessness would include the situation where any Account User deliberately did not comply with requirements under these terms. You are required to provide us with information we may reasonably require to assist us to determine whether or not any Account User was reckless. </p>

<p>38.2 For the avoidance of doubt, where any Account User knew of and consented to a transaction (“Authorised Transaction”), such a transaction is not an Unauthorised Transaction, notwithstanding that the Account Holder may not have consented to the transaction. This would also include the situation where any Account User acts fraudulently to defraud any Account Holder or us. In such a case, the Account Holder shall be solely liable for the entire loss.</p>

<p>38.3. You are not liable for any loss arising from an Unauthorised Transaction if the loss arises from, solely on account of, any action or omission by us and does not arise from any failure by any Account User to comply with any duty in this agreement.</p>

<p>38.4. Any action or omission by us includes the following:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>fraud or negligence by us, our employee, our agent or any outsourcing service provider contracted by us to provide our services through the Protected Account;</p></li>
<li><p>non-compliance by us or our employee with any requirement imposed by a regulatory authority on us in respect of our provision of any financial service;</p></li>
<li><p>non-compliance by us with any duty set out in this agreement.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>38.5. You are not liable for any loss arising from an Unauthorised Transaction that does not exceed $1,000, if the loss arises from any action or omission by any third party not referred to in paragraph 37.4 above and does not arise from any failure by any Account User to comply with any duty under this agreement.</p>

<p>38.6 Where the Protected Account is a joint account, the liability for losses set out in this section applies jointly to each Account Holder in a joint account.</p>

<h3 id="39.-specific-duties-in-relation-to-erroneous-transactions."><strong>39. Specific duties in relation to Erroneous Transactions.</strong></h3>

<p>39.1 Where you inform us in accordance with this section that you or an Account User has initiated a payment transaction from a Protected Account such that money has been placed with or transferred to the wrong recipient (“<strong>Erroneous Transaction</strong>”), we will inform the wrongful recipient’s FI of the Erroneous Transaction promptly as much as practicable, to the FI of the wrong recipient and shall make reasonable efforts to recover the sum sent in error. </p>

<p>39.2 For the purposes of paragraph above, reasonable efforts mean the following:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>where we are the FI of Account Holder:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>within two business days of receiving the necessary information from you under this section, we shall inform the recipient FI of the erroneous transaction;</p></li>
<li><p>within seven business days of informing the recipient FI, we shall ask the recipient FI for the recipient’s response and provide you with any new relevant information to allow you to assess if you should make a police report about the erroneous transaction.</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>where we are the FI of the wrong recipient:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>within two business days of receiving the necessary information about any Erroneous Transaction, we will:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Inform the recipient of the erroneous transaction and all necessary information that would allow the recipient to determine if the transaction was indeed erroneous;</p></li>
<li><p>Ask the recipient for instructions on whether to send the sum sent in error back to you; and</p></li>
<li><p>Inform the recipient that his retention or use of sums transferred to him erroneously where he has had notice of the erroneous transaction is an offence under the penal code.</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>within five business days of receiving the necessary information about any erroneous transaction, we will:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Ask the recipient for instructions whether to send the sum sent in error back to the Account Holder; and</p></li>
<li><p>Inform the other FI about the recipient’s response, including nil responses.</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>


<p>39.3 For the purposes of assisting the FIs to recover sums sent in error, you should provide us with any of the following information as requested by us:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>all such information that we may request as set out in section 33.3);</p></li>
<li><p>the recipient’s unique identifier, including account number, identification number, name or other credentials entered by the Account User; and</p></li>
<li><p>the date, time, amount and purpose of the erroneous transaction insofar as such information is known to you.</p></li>
</ol>
