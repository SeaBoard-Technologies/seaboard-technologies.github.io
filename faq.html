                <div class="accordion-content">
                  <p>If you are a Resident Indian (RI), which means you did not complete 183 days of sailing, you may need to declare your SeaBoard account for tax purposes. To do so, you will need to transfer the money from your SeaBoard account to your home country bank account and declare it to relevant authorities.</p>
                  <p>If you are a Non-Resident-Indian (NRI), which means you have completed 183 days of sailing, you may not need to declare the SeaBoard account. There is no limit to how much you can hold in your account. However, you may need to do so if you become a RI.</p>
                  <p>If you are unsure of your residential status, please consult with a chartered accountant (CA) or a tax specialist.</p>
