            <h1 id="mob">Maritime <em>Open</em> Banking</h1>
            <p>We are a diverse group of problem-solvers building a platform and super-app for the maritime space.</p>
            <p>Our practical goal is to empower seafarers to have better control over their money, finances and career opportunities. This, we hope will transform the lives of seafarers and the people around them.</p>
            <p>Our long-term vision is to empower seafarers while transforming the shipping sector to be part of a sustainable, transparent and efficient world. As a traditional yet foundational sector in our global society we believe in the significant potential of transformation.</p>
            <p>We are a seed-stage corporate venture started with global growth ambitions starting from South, Southeast and East Asia. We are looking to build a global team headquartered in Singapore, the world's prime finance and shipping hub.</p>
            
				<h2>Who are we looking for?</h2>
            <p>We are building a small but strong and nimble product engineering and design team with a basic operations support team to build a sustainable and scalable product MVP and be able to roll it out to our first customers.
            <p>While we want to be selective with who we bring on, we also need to ramp up our team reasonably quickly as to develop the product swiftly and well.<br />Thus we are looking for people that:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Share our values</li>
                <li>Are keen, smart and get stuff done with curiosity, enthusiasm, craftpersonship and a sense of humour</li>
                <li>Take ownership in their work and the success of the team</li>
                <li>Take a stance and are willing to discuss openly in order to build clarity and momentum</li>
            </ol>
            
	h2>What can we offer?</h2>
            <p>We want a diverse and inclusive work environment with focus on creating meaningful impact, not formalities. While we are looking to build teams in Singapore and India, we want our team to be effective while distributed. We believe this requires some co-location and overlap in time zone, but it does not require being in an office daily. Instead, we aim to collaborate online, asynchronously first and foremost.<br />We offer:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Interesting and challenging work in a keen team</li>
                <li>Growth opportunity in a company with budget for learning and courses and the opportunity to share and learn from peers internally and externally</li>
                <li>Competitive salary and employee-friendly equity</li>
                <li>BYOD or a decent work machine (macOS, Windows or Linux) with a budget for accessories and tools</li>
                <li>Regular team events and off-sites</li>
                <li>Annual vacation policy of minimum 12 days; no cap, as we trust that you know when you need a break</li>
                <li>Autonomy, some fun and the opportunity to build the organisation you want to work at with a career path that is wide open as we grow</li>
            </ul>
